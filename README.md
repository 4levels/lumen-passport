Making Laravel Passport work with Lumen

A simple service provider that makes Laravel Passport work with Lumen

## Dependencies

* PHP >= 5.5
* Lumen >= 5.3

## Installation via Composer

To install simply run:

```
composer require dusterio/lumen-passport
```

Or add it to `composer.json` manually:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "dusterio/lumen-passport": "~0.1"
    }
}
```

### Add it in the bootstrap flow

```php
// Add in your bootstrap/app.php
$app->register(Dusterio\LumenPassport\PassportServiceProvider::class);
```

### Installed routes

Adding this service provider, will mount the following routes:

Verb | Path | NamedRoute | Controller | Action | Middleware
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
POST   | /oauth/token                             |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\AccessTokenController           | issueToken | -
GET    | /oauth/tokens                            |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\AuthorizedAccessTokenController | forUser    | auth
DELETE | /oauth/tokens/{token_id}                 |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\AuthorizedAccessTokenController | destroy    | auth
POST   | /oauth/token/refresh                     |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\TransientTokenController        | refresh    | auth
GET    | /oauth/clients                           |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\ClientController                | forUser    | auth
POST   | /oauth/clients                           |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\ClientController                | store      | auth
PUT    | /oauth/clients/{client_id}               |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\ClientController                | update     | auth
DELETE | /oauth/clients/{client_id}               |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\ClientController                | destroy    | auth
GET    | /oauth/scopes                            |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\ScopeController                 | all        | auth
GET    | /oauth/personal-access-tokens            |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\PersonalAccessTokenController   | forUser    | auth
POST   | /oauth/personal-access-tokens            |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\PersonalAccessTokenController   | store      | auth
DELETE | /oauth/personal-access-tokens/{token_id} |            | \Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers\PersonalAccessTokenController   | destroy    | auth

Please note that some of the Laravel Passport's routes had to 'go away' because they are web-related and rely on sessions (eg. authorise pages). Lumen is an
API framework so only API-related routes are present.

## Configuration

Edit config/auth.php to suit your needs. A simple example:

```php
return [
    'defaults' => [
        'guard' => 'api',
        'passwords' => 'users',
    ],

    'guards' => [
        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'passport',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
    ],

    'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => \App\User::class
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Todo

1. Add more unit and integration tests
